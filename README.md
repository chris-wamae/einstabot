# Einstabot
Einstabot is an AI chatbot developed with the goal of making learning Physics more fun and interactive

## How it works
The chatbot is made accessible to users through a website [einstabot.netlify.app](https://einstabot.netlify.app).
When users first visit the website, a chat icon appears on the bottom left which opens the chat with the chatbot when clicked.
The chatbot then initiates the chat with a greeting followed by a list of the Physics topics it is conversant with.
The user can then type the topic name or number to start learning through the chatbot. It is important to note that the chatbot is fully conversational, meaning that the user does not have to choose from the options listed by the chatbot but they can instead ask any Physiscs questions directly.
