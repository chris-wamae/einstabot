# Einstabot
Einstabot is an AI chatbot developed with the goal of making learning Physics more fun and interactive.

## How it works
Einstabot is made accessible to users through a website [einstabot.netlify.app](https://einstabot.netlify.app).
When users first visit the website, a chat icon appears on the bottom left which opens the chat with Einstabot when clicked.
Einstabot then initiates the chat with a greeting followed by a list of the Physics topics it is conversant with.
The user can then type the topic name or number to start learning through the chatbot. It is important to note that Einsabot is fully conversational, meaning that the user does not have to choose from the options listed by the chatbot but they can instead ask any Physiscs questions directly. 

## Chatbot Development
Einstabot has been developed using [Tidio AI customer service software](https://www.tidio.com/about/). Tidio provides a base chatbot that is capable of conversing in natural language. From this staring point, we began by adding the Physics knowledge to the chabot using CSV files. 

After this, we worked on giving the chatbot a fun and engaging personality. This involved setting the personality of the chatbot to be more friendly rather than formal, making it use emojis in conversation as well as ensuring it always maintains a positive attitude. 

Following this, we worked on improving the general user experience. Some of the functionalities we added towards this end are: 
1. Making Einsabot ask for the user's name and remember it in future conersations.
2. Time appropriate greetings from Einstabot.
3. Asking follow up questions after replies and suggesting additional topics.

## Einstabot Status
Einstabot is currently not under development.
